# DUGONG DEMO

To test the operation of Dugong and demonstrate the ease of use and the possibility of using the service in different operating systems and platforms we provide some installation templates on dply.co's servers.

**dply.co** allows the creation of an absolutely free server for two hours, and can be used for a longer time for payment. If you choose not to buy more time for the server, it is deleted automatically after 2 hours without any charge.

dply.co servers are hosted in the DigitalOcean cloud and have the following specifications:

- 1 CPU
- 512MB RAM
- 20GB Disk

We currently offer the following operating systems: CentOS 6, CentOS 7, Debian 7, Debian 8, Fedora 24, Fedora 25, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04.

For more information on how to use this service and how to create and connect to your newly created server, go to: https://dply.co/help/faq

# Comments:

- The process of installing the docker service and Dugong deploy can take up to 5 minutes. I recommend that you wait for the installation process and use the command below to check if Dugong is already available:

$ docker ps
